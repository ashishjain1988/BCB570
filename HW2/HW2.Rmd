i). As from the table, the number of nodes for graph A and C is close to the number of edges. Apart from that, the graph density which is the ratio of the edges and number of possible edges is very low. From these two parameters we can say that Graph A and C are sparse. In the case of graph B, the number of edges is not close to either the number of nodes or $nodes^{2}$. So, from that we can say that this graph is somewhere in-between.

ii). The diameter and the radius of the graphs is shown in table 1.

iii). The global clustering coefficient is the ratio of the number of the traingles or closed triplets and the number of connected triples of vertices in the graph. On the other hand, the average clustering coefficient is the average of the local clustering coefficient of all the vertices in the graph. The local clustering coefficient is the ratio of the triangles connected to the vertex and the triples centered on the vertex. From their definations, the difference between them is that global clustering coefficient puts more weight on the high degree nodes, while the local clustering coefficient places more weight on the low degree nodes.

iv).The average shortest path length of the graphs is shown in table 1.

v). Degree centrality and Betweenness centrality have been used to find central nodes.
Degree centrality is defined as the number of edges incident upon a link.
Betweeness centrality is another centrality measure in a graph. It quantifies the number of times a node acts as a bridge along the shortest path between two other nodes.

The overlap between the central nodes measured by these centrality measures is very high. The results of the overlap between the central nodes for the three graphs is shown in table 1. In graph A, B, and C, there are 2, 4, and 4 common central nodes out of top 5 nodes. These nodes are found to be central because the connections of the those nodes is very large due to which they appears frequently in the shortest path between several nodes. These nodes are also called as hub nodes due to their easier access and strong interaction with other nodes.

#Question 6:
To check for small-world property of the networks, we can do the following:

i). Compute degree distribution of the network.

ii). Try to fit a power law distribution to the degree distribution.

iii). Compare clustering coefficients of the network with that of a random network with same number of nodes and edges.

iv). Compare average path lengths of the network with that of a random network with 
same number of nodes and edges.

v). For a small world network:



#Question 7:
To check for scale-free property of the networks, we can do the following:

i). Plot degree distribution vs # of nodes (log-log scale) to check for a linear decreasing 
relation.

ii). Plot clustering coefficient vs # of nodes (log-log scale) to check for a constant line.

iii). Check if there are few hubs.

iv). Try to fit a power law distribution to the degree distribution and if p<0.05, the network is not  cale free.

v). Take a subset of the network and check if it retains the properties of the full network.

vi). Expand the network (with more real data or accurately simulated data) and check if it retains the properties of the full network.
